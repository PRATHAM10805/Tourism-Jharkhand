# Authentication System Documentation

## Overview
Complete authentication system for Jharkhand Tourism website with login, signup, logout, and profile management.

## Features Implemented

### üîê Authentication Flow
- **User Registration**: Name, email, password, phone validation
- **User Login**: Email/password authentication with JWT tokens
- **User Logout**: Secure logout with token cleanup
- **Profile Management**: View and edit user profile information
- **Protected Routes**: Authentication middleware for secure endpoints

### üéØ Frontend Components

#### 1. Authentication Page (`/app/auth/page.tsx`)
- Toggle between login and signup modes
- Form validation (email format, password length, phone number)
- Real-time error handling and feedback
- Integration with authentication hook
- Responsive design with maroon/navy/gold theme

#### 2. Authentication Hook (`/hooks/use-auth.ts`)
- Global authentication state management
- Persistent login state across page reloads
- Token and user data storage in localStorage
- Centralized login/logout functions
- User profile updates

#### 3. Enhanced Navigation (`/components/navigation.tsx`)
- Dynamic UI based on authentication state
- User dropdown menu when logged in

- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT token generation (7-day expiry)
- User registration with duplicate email check
- Login with password verification
- Profile management endpoints
- Account status validation

#### Security Middleware
- Rate limiting (500 requests/15 minutes)
- CORS protection for localhost origins
- Helmet security headers
- Input validation and sanitization
- Protected route authentication

### üì° API Endpoints

```
POST /api/auth/register    - User registration
POST /api/auth/login       - User authentication

1. Navigate to `/auth` page
2. Register a new account or login with existing credentials
3. Upon successful authentication, user is redirected to `/destinations`
4. Navigation shows user menu with profile access and logout
5. Visit `/profile` to view and edit profile information

#### Authentication Flow
1. User submits login/signup form
2. Frontend validates input and sends to backend
3. Backend verifies credentials/creates user
4. JWT token generated and returned to frontend
5. Token and user data stored in localStorage
6. Navigation updates to show authenticated state
7. Protected routes accessible with valid token
